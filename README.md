# Hand-Tracker

This program implements computer vision principles. The libraries OpenCV and MediaPipe were used in the creation of this program. It creates a window that displays a live feed from your webcam. Using each frame, the program implements a hand tracking algorithm from the MediaPipe library to track hand position in each frame. The result is a live hand tracking software that updates in real time.
